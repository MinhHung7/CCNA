# Switch
- Typically has 24+ interfaces (24+ ports)
- Các lỗ cắm được gọi là RJ - 45 (RJ = **Register Jack**)
- The RJ - 45 connector is used on the end of a copper Ethernet cable
# Etherner
- Ethernet is a collection of network protocols / standards
- Ethernet Standards
  - Defined in the IEEE 802.3 standards in 1983
  - IEEE = **Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineeers**
  - ![](https://github.com/MinhHung7/CCNA/blob/main/IEEE%20Standards.png)
  - BASE = **Baseband signalling**
  - T = **Twisted pair**
  - UTP = **Unshielded Twisted Pair**
# Speed
- Mesured by **bits per second**
- Not **bytes per second**
# Full - Duplex
- It means that both devices and send data at the same time, and no problem happens because they use separate wires to transmit and receive data
# Auto MDI-X
- Allows devices to automatically detect which pins their neightbor is transmitting data on, and then adjust them
# SFP transceiver
- SFP = **Small Form-Factor Plaggable**
# Fiber-optic cable
- 4 part
  - 1. The fiberglass core itself
    2. cladding that reflects light
    3. a protective buffer
    4. the outer jacket of the cable
- 2 types
- Single-mode fiber
- Multi-mode fiber
